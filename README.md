# PingJS
PingJS is a client/service monitoring server written in TypeScript using NodeJS. It will notify stakeholders when specified clients (via ICMP) or services (via TCP ports) are either online or offline, based upon defined triggers. Notifications are currently sent via SMTP but 
with plans to add Webhooks and Slack/Teams notifications. 

### NOTE: PingJS is a WIP and **NOT** production ready.
